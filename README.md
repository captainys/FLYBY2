# FLYBY2

Someone [found](https://twitter.com/lazygamereviews/status/1488155893149614084) my screensaver left in a PC that once was used by Lockheed Martine, and [posted on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAQt33Gj3KY):

So, I excavated source code from my backups and set up build for *Windows* and *FM TOWNS OS*.

I made source code available from the following URL:

- https://github.com/captainys/FLYBY2

I never expected someone finds my screensaver from a quarter century ago. It was so amazing!

I didn't remember where I released it. But later I found that it was included in a CD-ROM bundled with a book I published back in 1996:

- `Soji Yamakawa, "3D Screensaver SDK Saber", ASCII, 1996, ISBN4-7561-1403-2`

I think only Windows version screensaver was in this CD-ROM. So, I believe it is the first release for FM TOWNS.

It requires 486DX or faster (needs FPU), and it needs to be launched from Towns OS V2.1 L31 or newer because the executable is in .EXG format.

I have tested on [Tsugaru](http://ysflight.in.coocan.jp/FM/towns/Tsugaru/e.html) â€” an open-source FM Towns Emulator:
